# Leaflet-Challenge: USGS Earthquake Data Visualizations

## Overview
 For the Module 15 Challenge, we help the USGS create visualizations of earthquake data so they can better educate the public and government organizations on potential issues facing the planet. To do so, we use Leaflet and D3.js to create an interactive map that shows the magnitude and depth of recent earthquakes around the world. 
 
 ## Features
 
    -Interactive Map: Displays earthquake data on a map, allowing users to zoom in and out.
    -Magnitude-based Markers: Earthquake markers vary in size based on the magnitude of the earthquake.
    -Depth-based Colors: Earthquake markers are color-coded based on the depth of the earthquake.
    -Popups: Clicking on a marker shows the location, magnitude, and depth of the earthquake
    -Legend: the legend explains the color coding of earthquake depths.
    
## Technologies Used
    -HTML5
    -CSS3
    -JavaScript
    -Leaflet.js: A popular open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
    -D3.js: A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers.
    -USGS Earthquake Data (GeoJSON)

## File Overview
- 'leaflet-challenge'(https://github.com/jackthomas1430/leaflet-challenge.git) :The main repo for this challenge. 
- 'index.html': The main HTML file for the dashboard.
-'stle.css': contains styles for the webpage
- 'logic.js': contains the JavaScript code for the interactive map 
- 'Leaflet-Part-1': Directory containing 'app.js'
- Use the following link to access map through Github Pages: (https://jackthomas1430.github.io/leaflet-challenge/)

       
## Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local device using git clone ()
2. Open the Project: Copy path for 'index.html' and open in your web browser to view interactive map
3. Use the following link to access the map: https://github.com/jackthomas1430/leaflet-challenge.git

## Usage

Once the project is loaded in your browser, you will see a map centered on the United States. The map displays recent earthquake data. You can zoom in/out and pan around the map to explore different areas. You can also click on any earthquake marker to view the magnitude, location, and depth of the earthquake.
